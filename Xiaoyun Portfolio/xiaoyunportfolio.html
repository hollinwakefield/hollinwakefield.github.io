    <h3>About</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>My birth name is Quanyun Xu, but my friends and family call me Xiaoyun, which means little cloud. I am an artist, and I believe that art is in everything we do, whether we realize it or not.</p>
            
            <img src="images/background/xiaoyun.jpg" width=20%>

            <p>I was born in Ankang, a small town in China, as a second child while China was observing its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">one-child policy</a>.</p>
            
            <p>To avoid getting in trouble with the government, I grew up in the countryside with my grandparents. I did not go to school for the first time until I was 10 years old. We had very little technology — no phones, no television, no internet — so most of my childhood was spent outside having fun with my cousins and with my grandparents and me taking care of each other. My mom has eight siblings, so I have countless cousins.</p>

            <p>The postsecondary education system in China is very different from that of the Western world. I always dreamed of going to art school, but my parents wanted me to be a teacher. I passed all of the tests required to go to the best art schools in China, but I did not do well on my tests to become a teacher, and at my parents' behest, I ended up studying accounting.</p>

            <p>My parents wanted me to stay closer to home, but I decided to attend a university in Qingdao — a city with some German influence that produces a famous beer called Tsingtao. My decision to study in Qingdao and the fact that Tsingtao is produced in Qingdao are completely unrelated. I earned my Associate's degree in accounting and while working towards my Bachelor's degree, I met my now husband, a French teacher from the United States.</p>

            <p>I soon moved to the US with my husband, where we live in California with our two dogs (Mozzie and Summer) and sulcata tortoise (Momo). I am currently pursuing an Associate's degree in Studio Arts at Berkeley City College while working toward my dream of attending art school and becoming a professional artist.</p>
        <h4>Travel</h4>
            <p>My husband and I love traveling. See pictures from our travels in China and across the United States. We dream of someday traveling together in Europe!</p>
